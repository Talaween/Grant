# Grant
Role-based Access Control Library for Haxe, Inspired from accesscontrol Library on npm, however Grant brings more flexibity and features to manage RBAC.

The idea of Grant is that all RBAC should be kept outside code, it is maintained in a JSON   file and RBAC can be easily changed by only modifying the JSON data.
